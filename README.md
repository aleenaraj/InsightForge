# InsightForge-BI

**Enabling AI-Powered Business Intelligence for Organizations**
## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 AI-Powered Data Analysis
- 📊 Interactive Data Visualizations
- 🤖 Integration with LLM and RAG


## Problem Statement
In today's data-driven business environment, organizations across industries accumulate vast amounts of data. However, many struggle to effectively transform this data into actionable insights, particularly small to medium enterprises that lack resources for sophisticated business intelligence tools.

## Objectives
InsightForge aims to address these challenges by developing an automated AI model using advanced technologies such as LangChain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Large Language Models (LLMs). This model will:
- Analyze Business Data: Provide comprehensive data analysis, identifying key trends and patterns.
- Generate Insights and Recommendations: Use natural language processing to deliver actionable business insights.
- Visualize Data Insights: Present data insights through visualizations for easier interpretation.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Focus on analyzing and extracting insights from pre-prepared data.
2. **Knowledge Base Creation**: Load, explore, and organize data for retrieval and analysis.
3. **LLM Application Development**: Develop advanced data summaries, integrate RAG, and implement prompt engineering.
4. **Chain Prompts**: Design prompts to ensure the LLM produces coherent and contextually relevant responses.
5. **RAG System Setup**: Implement the RAG system for enhanced data retrieval and response generation.
6. **Memory Integration**: Integrate memory systems to improve the relevance of responses.
7. **Model Evaluation and Visualization**: Apply QAEvalChain and create visualizations to assess model performance and present insights.
